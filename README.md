### Dominique's Personal Website 

My personal website created with the purpose of sharing my progress in web development.

I primarily utilized flexbox for my website due to its responsiveness and simplicity when structuring layouts.

I plan to add additional projects to my personal website, and highlight further skills that I've achieved as I continue to deepen my knowledge of web development.
