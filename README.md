## Welcome To My Personal Website 

- My personal website created with the purpose of sharing my projects and progress in web development. 

## Creating my personal website

- I primarily utilized flexbox for my website due to its responsiveness and simplicity when structuring layouts.

## Next steps 

- I plan to add additional projects to my personal website, and highlight further skills that I've achieved as I continue to deepen my knowledge of web development. 

- I will also be incorporating JavaScript in future updates for interactivity, while also perodically going over my website to address any bugs, or changes that can take place.
